Organization-level workflows and templates for Butterscotch Shenanigans.

**⚠ This repo is PUBLIC ⚠** (This is required by GitHub for it to work properly.)

*Note: The contents of this repo are likely to be specific to Bscotch's needs and are not intended for general use.*

GitHub treats repos named `.github` differently than others. It essentially acts the way a `.github` *folder* does inside a regular repo -- it's a place to put things that allow GitHub to do GitHubby things.

Templates stored here are available to all other repos in the organization.

Workflows defined here can act upon organization-level events, such as for management of organization-level "Projects" (GitHub's KanBan boards).
